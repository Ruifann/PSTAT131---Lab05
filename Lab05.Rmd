## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
library(glmnet)
tidymodels_prefer()
```

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

```{r}
# install.packages("janitor")
```
```{r}
library(janitor)
```
```{r}
pokemon <- read_csv("~/Downloads/homework-5/data/Pokemon.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
```
Before using clean.names function, the column name of the pokemon data is not organized and is hard to code with. Now, the data column names contains only letters, numbers and underscores. It is useful because in later analysis, we can use more proper names to code with. Invalid column names can cause coding error.


### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

```{r}
pokemon %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1)) +
  geom_bar()
```


How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?
```{r}
table(pokemon$type_1)
```
There are 18 classes of the outcome are here and the flying type has very few pokemon.

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.
```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Bug" | type_1 == "Fire" | type_1 =="Grass" | type_1 =="Normal" | type_1 =="Water" | type_1 =="Psychic")
table(pokemon$type_1)
```

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.
```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  mutate(type_1 = as.factor(type_1)) %>%
  mutate(legendary = as.factor(legendary))
class(pokemon$type_1)
class(pokemon$legendary)
```


### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.
Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
set.seed(116)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop =0.8, strata = "type_1")

pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)

pokemon_fold <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = "type_1")

458*0.8  #Which is 366.4, so it is reasonable to have 364 observations in the training data.

```
Because we have 6 different categories in type_1, which means we can divide the observation into 6 groups, it is reasonable to stratifying the 5 folds.



### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;


```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def,
                         data = pokemon_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```

- Center and scale all predictors.

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

```{r}
ridge_spec <- 
  multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")
```

```{r}
ridge_workflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(ridge_spec)
```

```{r}
penalty_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0, 1)), levels = 
                               c(penalty = 10, mixture =10))
penalty_grid
```



How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?

The total model I willbe fitting is 500, which is 5*100.  


### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

```{r}
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  ridge_workflow,
  resamples = pokemon_fold, 
  grid = penalty_grid
)

tune_res
```
```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```
What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

Based on the graph, I noticed that smaller values of penalty and mixture produce better accuracy and ROC AUC. aT 1e-03, both accuracy and ROC AUC start decreasing and in the middle of 1e03 to 1e00, both accuracy and ROC AUC decrease dramatically. 

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res)
```
```{r}
best_penalty <- select_best(tune_res, metric = "roc_auc")
best_penalty
```
```{r}
ridge_final <- finalize_workflow(ridge_workflow, best_penalty)

ridge_final_fit <- fit(ridge_final, data = pokemon_train)
```

```{r}
augment(ridge_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)
```
The accuracy of our model is 0.436, which is not bad, but also not very good.


### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.



Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

```{r}
final = augment(ridge_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test)
final %>% roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>%
  autoplot()
```
```{r}
final %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```


What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

I noticed that my model does not perform very good, especially on predicting grass Pokemon. The best type preditted is normal. I think the reason is that we do not have enough numerical observations to generate enough data to fit the model. However, normal Pokemon has a larger amount of data than grass. Also, we only used 5 folds in the first place. That may also be the reason of our bad predicting.
